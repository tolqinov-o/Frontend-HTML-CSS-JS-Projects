                                        As of my last knowledge update in December 2023, there is no widely recognized
                                        institution or entity known as "Wood Academy." It's possible that it could be a
                                        very new or niche organization that has been established after my last update.

                                        in December 2023, I am unable to provide specific details about what you can
                                        expect from a class at Wood Academy.

                                        last update in December 2023, I do not have details on enrollment criteria or
                                        requirements. Typically, educational institutions have varying criteria for
                                        enrollment, which can include factors such as age restrictions, educational
                                        background, prerequisites, and other considerations.

                                        information available about the instructors at Wood Academy. Typically, the

                                        their individual backgrounds, expertise, and qualifications.

                                        Accreditation is an important aspect to consider when evaluating the quality and
                                        recognition of educational programs.
